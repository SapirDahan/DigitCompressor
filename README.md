# DigitCompressor

DigitCompressor is a C-based utility that compresses text files containing single-digit numbers into a binary format and decompresses binary files back to text. This tool operates on digits 0-9, representing them in a custom 4-bit binary format, and supports both encoding (text to binary) and decoding (binary to text).
